Ten-Seconds-to-Death
====================

An entry for the Ludum Dare Jam 27. It's a top down fighting game that revolves
around beating down your opponent and then using your character's ultimate move
to them off. The twist is that this ultimate move is automatically activated
every ten seconds - whether you are ready or not.

The three songs included with the game - Blaze on, Inert Exponent, and KiloByte -
